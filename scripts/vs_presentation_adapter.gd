# VS presentation orchestration adapter
# (NRCU_VS_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF_v2_0 §8-§10, generalized by the
#  NRCU_VS_MULTIPLAYER_FOLLOWUP_HANDOFF_v1_3 contract).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
#   The VS overlay is a presentation module, the match start is the frontend
#   router's job, and neither should absorb the other. This adapter is the ONLY
#   place that knows both:
#     * it decides whether a launch CONFIG is a supported VS case: an ordered
#       list of 2-4 active fighter records (v1.3), every fighter in the
#       presentation roster AND the facing authority, and a route defined by
#       schema/match_presentation_contract.json;
#     * it builds the normalized presentation plan
#       (scripts/vs_presentation_request.gd), which preserves each fighter's
#       original player (P1-P4) identity and team id;
#     * it mounts the overlay above everything else and routes the launch:
#       - 2 active fighters  -> the approved DUEL_1V1 renderer through the
#         existing start(left_fighter_id, right_fighter_id, stage_id)
#         compatibility wrapper, so 1v1 output stays visually and temporally
#         identical;
#       - 3/4 active fighters -> the generalized multiplayer renderer
#         start_presentation(plan) (FFA_3/FFA_4/TEAM_2V2/TEAM_2V1/TEAM_3V1 and
#         the mirrored 1V2/1V3 variants);
#     * it forwards the match-readiness handoff and the cover handoff back to
#       the host.
#   The host (MatchFlow) keeps one narrow call site per direction, so gameplay
#   code carries no VS logic at all.
#
# BYPASS IS THE CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT
#   supported_reason() returns a NON-EMPTY reason string for anything the
#   handoff does not cover (invalid config, Story/Bobo encounters, an active
#   count outside 2-4, an unknown fighter, a team split with no supported
#   route), and the host then keeps its existing immediate match-start path. No
#   UI is invented for those cases (contract §10). The v1.3 handoff REPLACES
#   the old "not exactly two active fighters" bypass: 3/4-player configurations
#   with supported fighters now take the multiplayer route instead of the
#   immediate path; only the unsupported shapes above still bypass.
#
# LOADER SAFETY
#   The overlay is mounted on the tree ROOT, not under the host: the host
#   releases itself over the live destination (its authored LAUNCH fade frees
#   it), and the overlay must outlive the cover -> reveal handoff. The overlay
#   frees itself on exit_finished; the adapter dies with its host.
#
# Events exposed for tests/evidence:
#   bypassed(reason)   the VS presentation did not take this launch
#   started            the overlay began ENTRY
#   cover_reached      forwarded from the overlay at full cover
#   finished           forwarded after the reveal, when the overlay is freed
